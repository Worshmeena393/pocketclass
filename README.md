ðŸ“˜ Pocket Classroom

Offline Learning SPA â€” Notes, Flashcards & Quiz Capsules

Project Overview

Pocket Classroom is a single-page web application (SPA) for creating, learning, and sharing mini learning "capsules" offline. Each capsule can contain:

Notes (multi-line)

Flashcards (front/back with flip animation)

Quizzes (multiple-choice with scoring)

Capsules are saved in LocalStorage and can be exported/imported as JSON files. The app works entirely offline and requires no backend.
